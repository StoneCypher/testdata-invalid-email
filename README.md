So ... what is this?
--------------------

This is two things:

1. A dataset of invalid email addresses to be used by testing kits
1. A place where, as the rules change and expand (yes they do,) things may be locally kept up to date
  * Examples:
    * Punycode
    * IDNs
    * Unicode characters in name extension
    * New gTLDs
    * New ccTLDs
    * IPv6 rules
    * Local routing domains
